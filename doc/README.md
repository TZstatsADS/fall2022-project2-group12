# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  
Each folder contains each individual's code. Since the final project is an app and not a tangible, static app the final project will not be found here, but the code needed to run our app is in /app.
Thank you!
