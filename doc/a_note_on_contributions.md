Team members: Donglai Xu, Nour Moustafa-Fahmy, Yuli Yin, Xilin Huang, Sherry Zhang

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the classification accuracy for images of cats and dogs to 99.9%

[Contribution Statement] 

- Donglai:
Coding the Covid-19 statistics part of shiny app. Discussing the topic and writing
the conclusion with the other group members.

- Xilin (Icey Huang):
Find the possible dataset from housing agency. Come up with the idea of plotting
electricity consumption on map and give possible output graphs from that dataset.
By adding Yuli’s idea, adding three types of energy consumption (electricity,water
and heating gas) map to our project. Decide the specific date range we use in our
projectof energy consumption part. Response for the code of energyconsumption
map of the 4th tab. Contribute the conclusion part with all the other group
members.

- Yuli:
Led the discussion of main topic and built the framework of the project. Took
responsibility for the energy consumption part with Xilin by investigating into the
energy datasets, came up with the line plot idea, and drew some conclusions. Wrote
the code and description for Tab1- Introduction and Tab 5 – Energy Yearly Trend.

- Nour:
Responsible for antibody section; heatmap of positive test percentages, yearly changes, and data table of poverty levels vs antibody rates.
Was also responsible for extending Yuli's project framework and merging everyone's code into final project, and debugging therein.

-  Yudan Zhang (Sherry):
1. Code the comparison between 3 types of energy consumption &amp; total Covid
cases counted by nyc’s 5 boroughs part in Shiny app. Responsible for the presentation. Organized the conclusion from each part of the Shiny app &amp; contribution in file. Provide the idea of the project outline that connects the energy consumption with Covid.
